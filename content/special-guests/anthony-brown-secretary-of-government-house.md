In this week's episode, Chantal and Haydn sit down with Anthony Brown inside of Government House. Anthony is the official secretary of Government house.

We talk about visa requirements, the rules governing renting a motor scooter (Haydn did take the test) and an overall recap of what you'll expect to find in the Cook Islands from a tourist perspective. Haydn also incorrectly speculates about the wrong Island in which Captain James Cook landed in the Cook Islands and so much more!
