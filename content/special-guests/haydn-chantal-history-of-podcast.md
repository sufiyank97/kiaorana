Chantal & Haydn sat down with each other to tell the back story of how the Kia Orana Podcast came about. During a pandemic, you have to make lemonade out of lemons. I, Haydn, had planned on flying to the islands this year, but that didn't work out.

Chantal shares the story behind her reaching out to Haydn, the author of the book How I Fell In Love with an Island. We connected and the rest is somewhat history.
