In this week's episode (a special Tuesday episode!), Chantal sits down with Teava Iro and talks about Down To Earth Compost Facility. The facility is focused on cleaning the waterways of Rarotonga through the use of charcoal, a small-scale replica of what he hopes can be scaled up.

In addition, he has compost available for the Rarotongans to use. Looking to visit? Head out to Titikaveka and use your nose.
