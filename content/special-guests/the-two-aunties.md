Aunty Lydia and Aunty Nane are literally the faces of the Cook Islands. At least in print. The two aunties sat down with Chantal and Haydn and talked about their history of growing up on Rarotonga, how life was like back before automatic washing machines and how the island nation is well suited to be self-sustainable, especially in these current times where flights from other nations have all but been cut off due to the global pandemic.
