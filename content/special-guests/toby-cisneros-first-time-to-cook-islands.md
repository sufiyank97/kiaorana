In this week's episode, we sit down with Toby Cisneros, an expat originally from the United States, currently resident of the United Kingdom. He spent two weeks in the Cook Islands last year (it was partially Haydn's fault a la Instagram and Aitutaki's waters).

We talked to him about his experiences in the Cook Islands as a first timer, how the waters of Aitutaki were that blue and the lack of light pollution that was unlike anywhere else on earth. He also tells us about how he hitched a ride twice on Rarotonga and the spirit of the islanders towards tourists. A must-listen for all future tourists coming to Rarotonga. 

You'll learn what was one of the most memorable moments of his time and more in this special episode. 

Cheers,
Haydn
