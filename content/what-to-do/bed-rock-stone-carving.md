Situated on the back road in Matavera, Bed Rock Ltd is a small business owned by Anthony Brown. More than stone carving, Bed Rock Ltd. Is also a beautiful sculpture park and gallery which is freely open to visitors who are welcome to come for a pleasant stroll on manicured lawns to discover the different artworks around the garden. They will meet Michel, the stone carver and be able to watch as he works on his latest project. Sylvie, his spouse, who is also a painter and mixed media jewellery artist, will be delighted to answer any questions about the artworks and the carving process. We specialize in commemorative stonework, garden features and art sculpture and are able to create stone carvings to suit our clients' specifications.  The artworks can be purchased and for less suit-case friendly pieces, overseas shipment can easily be arranged.
