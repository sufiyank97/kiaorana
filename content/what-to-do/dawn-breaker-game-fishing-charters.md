<em>From Captain Brendon:</em>
The oceans of Rarotonga are my home. Let me share this fishing experience with you. 

I'm a passionate local fisherman & will try my utmost to get you onto fish and land them. I love getting up early and watching the sun rise! Being in the ocean and seeing the phosphorescent plankton light up as the hull of the boat parts the water.

I strive to provide you with a memorable ocean experience. From the time you step on board, to the time you step off. The thrill of not knowing what to expect is part of the excitement!

We target pelagic fish such as tuna, wahoo, mahi mahi and the odd marlin. Also along the way we share a few yarns and enjoy the scenery of our island paradise.
