Aere maru… in Cook Islands Maori means to ‘take it easy” and that is exactly how we want visiting families to feel when they stay in any one of our well-appointed and comfortable villas, complete with a BBQ on the deck.

We have a total of nine villas scattered around the main island of Rarotonga, both on the Eastern and Western sides of the island. So you can enjoy either a sunrise or moon-rise (if you’re lucky enough to be here during a full moon), or a sunset from our beautiful beaches. Our largest villas offer 4 and 5-bedroom layouts which are ideal for
small families or large groups wanting a ‘home away from home’ experience in beautiful Rarotonga. Couples will find the perfect place to elope, get married or enjoy their honeymoon. And our villas offer ample room for families and friends to celebrate the special occasion alongside them.
