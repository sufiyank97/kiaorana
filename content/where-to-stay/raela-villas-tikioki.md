Kia Orana,<br />
I’m Jana and New Zealand Maori, my hubby is Joe who is Cook Islander born and bred. We moved to the Cooks from overseas in November 2017 and have resided since. We have just kept building our small accommodation business and adding to it each year.  

It contains 3 modern self contained studio units with a swimming pool. It has beautiful mountain views, 300 meters from the sea water and newly established tropical gardens. 


<strong>Who would stay there? Families or singles </strong><br />
Adults only they can book all 3 villas or individually. So 6 people maximum on site.


<strong>Where on Rarotonga island is it?</strong> <br />
Located in Titikaveka village, on the south side in a little suburb called Tikioki. The difference with our villas are it’s 300m on the mountain side and walking distance from the beach. We are private and secluded away from the hustle and bustle best of both worlds. 

<strong>What’s close to it?</strong><br />
Famous Muri beach where all the lagoon cruises, island nights and water sports take place. Chantal’s Concierge Tour & Activity Booking Office. Modern resorts such as Pacific Resort, Nautilus, Muri Beach Hotel, Te Manava and Moana Sands where you can enjoy a happy hour drink.
