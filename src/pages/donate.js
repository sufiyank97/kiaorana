      <p>Telecommunications in the Cook Islands is capped and not unlimitedâ€” it is expensive compared to the outside world, due in part to the small population of users. In addition, Chantal and Haydn spend hours behind the scenes arranging interviews and then editing and uploading episodes that will always be free to you, the listener.</p>

      <p>If you're loving all of our episodes on the podcast, we'd love for you to be a financial backer of our endeavor. A donation will help to make the Kia Orana Podcast even more successful. We've made it easy, with either a one-time donation or a recurring payment that comes with some awesome perks.</p>

                We understand that recurring payments can be a larger fianncial investment. So we have a patreon page that, with payments over $20/month, comes some serious perks. Like being able to watch our Zoom (video) calls that ultimately turn into our podcasts.</p>
                <p>
                  In addition, at higher values, you'll have the ability to be listed on our show notes and receive shoutouts on future podcasts.
                </p>
